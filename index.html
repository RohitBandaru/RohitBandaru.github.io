          I am a software development engineer at Amazon in the Halo Tone Science team. I work on implementing machine learning to provide tone analysis on user speech.
          Prior to Amazon, I was at <em style="color:#B31B1B">Cornell University</em> where I focused on machine learning and computer vision research.
          I earned a B.S. and M.Eng in <em>computer science</em> with a minor in <em>electrical and computer engineering</em>.

              <h2>Dynamically Adding and Removing Neurons from Neural Networks</h2>
              <p>The goal of this project was to develop more
                general methods to learn efficient and effective
                neural network architectures for certain applications.
                It is difficult to find effective and efficient
                architectures for applications. This often leads to
                networks being larger and more inefficient than they
                need to be. We are developing an algorithm that can
                apply iterative pruning while also adding nodes to
                allow for a neural network to learn a better size
                and structure.
