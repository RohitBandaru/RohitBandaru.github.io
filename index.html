I worked to clone bacteriocin genes into E. Coli bacteria in order to develop a non-antibiotic treatment for bovine mastitis, which is a disease in cows. Although it is not my main field, I enjoy working in bioengineering/synthetic biology and am excited for its future potential. I developed the project entrepreneurally and secured sponsorships on the business subteam. I wrote a business plan and met with people on campus to improve the idea. I also helped with the web development of the wiki.</p>

                <p>For the current 2017 project, I trained the new members with wet lab work and continued with the entrepreneurial and sponsorship aspects of the business team. I am also working with the product development subteam to engineer hardware and software for the project.</p>

                I developed EngageApp, an application that allows a user to quickly search the database for a candidate to contact, and leave a voicemail. This application was meant to provide a quick way for job recruiters to search and contact target candidatates.

                <p>
                I began with UX/UI design. I studied the research of BJ Fogg and Nir Eyal to create an optimal user experience that will retain users. I wanted to design an intuitive app that keeps users coming back. I used Sketch to create mockups, and Invision to create prototypes. I used the UserTesting platform to test my prototype with real users. I then used this feedback to improve my designs.
                </p>
                <p>
                After going through multiple design cycles, I began developing the application for iOS with Swift. Using libraries such as SwiftyJSON, and Alamofire, I was able to write clean and extensible networking code. I also worked with many different development frameworks including AudioKit to record voicemails and MessageUI to send emails within the app.

                I also led development of the web application component of the system.

It also receives physical debugging data such as speed, position, and lean angle, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.

                <p>The main functions of the web application are navigation and data storage and analysis. The web server sends navigation data to the bicycle using the Google Maps API. It receives data from the hardware and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. There is also an interface to download and interact with the data. This data is physical state data from the bicycle (velocity, lean angle, etc.) and is used to optimize performance.
